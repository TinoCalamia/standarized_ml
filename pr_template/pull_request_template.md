# The ML Checklist

 <!--- REMOVE ALL SECTIONS THAT ARE IRRELEVANT FOR A NEW PR --->

## Understanding the requirements
- [ ] Identify key stakeholders that are relevant for the project and make sure you have set up communication channels
- [ ] Ensure decision makers are part of the team
- [ ] Pin down all business and technical requirements in written form
- [ ] Create a machine learning system design in visual and written form
- [ ] Decide if more data needs to be acquired through experimentation and design experiment if needed
- [ ] Write your project proposal and get approval

## Risk assessement
- [ ] Identify all risk types in the project
- [ ] Quantify risk for each individual risk and overall project risk
- [ ] Define mitigation actions and re-calculate the overall risk score

## Data quality
- [ ] Define data quality checks and acceptance thresholds
- [ ] Calculate the datasetâ€™s overall quality
- [ ] Implement automated data quality checks before training and predictions
- [ ] Define process for risk mitigation, if checks fails

## Ethical considerations
- [ ] Create a checklist for ethical considerations

## ML model generation
- [ ] Collect data and features for the model
- [ ] Use feature store to consume features
- [ ] Ensure that the training data is ethically fair
- [ ] Implement automated data quality checks before re-training
- [ ] Choose which challenger models will be used
- [ ] Evaluate your model for business impact, statistical performance & fairness
- [ ] Perform a bias analysis
- [ ] Store model artefact
- [ ] Write unit and integration tests

## Model deployment
- [ ] Build a CI/CD pipeline with all relevant stages
- [ ] Decide and prepare a rollout strategy
- [ ] Define your schedules
- [ ] Containerise the model artefact

## Monitoring
- [ ] Write tests for the quality of input data
- [ ] Measure model drift
- [ ] Perform health endpoint checks

## Documentation
- [ ] Write documentation file
- [ ] Create a model card

## Governance
- [ ] Ensure all aspects of data governance have been followed
